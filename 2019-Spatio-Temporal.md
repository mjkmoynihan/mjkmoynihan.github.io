title: "Spatio-Temporal Upsampling for Free Viewpoint Video Point Clouds"

excerpt: 'This paper presents an approach to upsampling point cloud sequences captured through a wide baseline camera
setup in a spatio-temporally consistent manner. The system uses edge-aware scene flow to understand the
movement of 3D points across a free-viewpoint video scene to impose temporal consistency. In addition
to geometric upsampling, a Hausdorff distance quality metric is used to filter noise and further improve the
density of each point cloud. Results show that the system produces temporally consistent point clouds, not
only reducing errors and noise but also recovering details that were lost in frame-by-frame dense point cloud
reconstruction. The system has been successfully tested in sequences that have been captured via both static
or handheld cameras.'
